# Syntax Guide

In Mercury, you can write slides in MDX.

> [!note] What is MDX?
> MDX (= Markdown + JSX) is an extension of Markdown that allows you to write JSX within Markdown files.
> For more details, see [https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx/](https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx/).

Mercury also extends some of MDX's syntax to make slide creation easier.
This guide will primarily focus on Mercury's extended features.

## Slide Separators

Slides are separated by `---`.

```md
# First Slide

This is the content of the first slide.

---

# Second Slide

This is the content of the second slide.
```

## Basic MDX Syntax

Within each slide, you can use basic MDX syntax.

```mdx
# Ordered List

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

---

# Unordered List

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

---

# Table

| Framework  | Library |
| ---------- | ------- |
| Waku       | React   |
| SolidStart | Solid   |
| SvelteKit  | Svelte  |

---

# Inline Elements

This is **bold** text and this is *italic* text.
This is `inline code`.
```

## Code Blocks

You can create code blocks by wrapping your code in triple backticks (` ``` `).

````mdx
```ts
const greet = (name: string) => `Hello, ${name}!`;
console.log(greet("World"));
```

```python
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("World"))
```
````

Mercury uses Shiki for syntax highlighting.
For a list of supported languages, please see https://shiki.style/languages.

There are also features to display line numbers, titles and so on.

````mdx
```rs title="main.rs" showLineNumbers
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```
````

For more features, please refer to [/docs/features/code-block](/docs/features/code-block).

## Mathematical Formulas

You can write mathematical formulas in $\LaTeX$ format.

```mdx
# Inline Formula

Example of an inline formula: $E = mc^2$

---

# Block Formula

$$\int_a^b f(x) \,dx = F(b) - F(a)$$
```

Mercury uses $\KaTeX$ for rendering.
For a list of supported $\LaTeX$ commands, please see https://katex.org/docs/supported.html.

See [/docs/features/mathematics](/docs/features/mathematics) for more details.

## Images

You can insert images just like in standard Markdown with `![alt](path)`.

```mdx
![Example Image](/example.png)
```

The path must be a public URL. Place your images in the `/public` folder and specify the path relative to `/public`.

Alternatively, by using Vite's [URL Import](https://vite.dev/guide/assets.html#importing-asset-as-url), you can place images outside the `/public` folder:

```mdx
import exampleImage from "./assets/example.png"

<img src={exampleImage} alt="Example Image" />
```

## Styling

You can use Tailwind CSS to style text and elements.

```mdx
# Custom Styles

<div className="bg-blue-500 text-white p-4 rounded">
  This is a custom **styled** `box`.

  - You can use Tailwind CSS classes
</div>
```

> [!tip] MDX syntax works inside elements too
> In MDX, you can use MDX syntax even within HTML/JSX elements.
> This is a powerful feature not found in standard Markdown.

## Custom Components

You can use your own React components within MDX.

```tsx title="src/components/Alert.tsx"
export const Alert = ({ type, children }: { type: "info" | "warning" }) => {
  return (
    <div className={`border-l-4 p-4 ${type === "info" ? "border-blue-500 bg-blue-100" : "border-yellow-500 bg-yellow-100"}`}>
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}
```

```mdx title="src/presentation.mdx"
import { Alert } from "./components/Alert"

# Alert Example

<Alert type="info">
  This is an info alert.
</Alert>
```

Leveraging this feature, you can create custom layouts:

```tsx title="src/components/TwoColsLayout.tsx"
import type { ReactNode } from "react";

export const TwoColsLayout = ({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) => (
  <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6">{children}</div>
);

export const Left = ({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) => (
  <div className="space-y-6">{children}</div>
);

export const Right = ({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) => (
  <div className="space-y-6">{children}</div>
);
```

````mdx title="src/presentation.mdx"
import { TwoColsLayout, Left, Right } from "./components/TwoColsLayout"

# TwoColsLayout

<TwoColsLayout>
  <Left>
    ### Left side

    - You can put any content here
    - Including lists, images, code blocks, etc.

    ```python
    def greet(name: str) -> str:
        return f"Hello, {name}!"
    ```
  </Left>
  <Right>
    ### Right side

    1. This is the right column
    2. You can also use **MDX** here

    $$
    \int_a^b f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)
    $$
  </Right>
</TwoColsLayout>
````
