# QR Code

Mercury bundles a `<QRCode>` component that lets you embed shareable links directly in your slides.
The component is available automatically inside MDX documents rendered by Mercury, and you can
also import it from `@mercurymd/react` when you need to use it manually.

## Basic Usage

Pass the value you want to encode through the `value` prop. By default the component renders a
square SVG that scales with the surrounding layout.

```mdx
<QRCode value="https://mercury-md.dev" />
```

You can also render the component manually by importing it:

```mdx
import { QRCode } from "@mercurymd/react"

<QRCode value="https://mercury-md.dev" />
```

## Customising the Appearance

### Size

Use the `size` prop to control the rendered width and height (in pixels). You can also set the
`width` and `height` attributes directly when you need independent values.

```mdx
<QRCode value="https://mercury-md.dev" size={200} />
```

### Colours

Set the `color` prop to adjust the foreground modules and `backgroundColor` to update the quiet
zone. Both accept any valid CSS colour value.

```mdx
<QRCode
  value="https://mercury-md.dev"
  color="#2563eb"
  backgroundColor="#eff6ff"
/>
```

### Quiet Zone (Margin)

The `margin` prop controls the amount of empty space (in modules) that surrounds the QR code. The
default value is `4`, which matches the common quiet zone recommendation. Set it to `0` when you
need the QR code to touch the container edges.

```mdx
<QRCode value="https://mercury-md.dev" margin={0} />
```

## Error Correction & Advanced Options

The component exposes a few additional knobs for advanced scenarios:

- `level` – sets the error correction level. Accepted values are `"L"`, `"M"`, `"Q"`, `"H"` as
  well as their long-form names (`"low"`, `"medium"`, `"quartile"`, `"high"`).
- `maskPattern` – forces a mask pattern from `0` to `7` when you need consistent visual output.
- `version` – locks the QR code version (1–40) instead of letting it scale automatically.
- `toSJISFunc` – provide this when you need Shift JIS support for kanji payloads.

These props are optional; Mercury will pick sensible defaults when they are not supplied.

## Accessibility

`<QRCode>` is rendered as an SVG with `role="img"`. Supply the `aria-label` prop to describe the
encoded content for assistive technologies when the default label does not fit your use case.
